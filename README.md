# Visualization of DC's K-12 Education Finance Disparities under the Impact of COVID


## Research Question 
We will evaluate the impact of financial disparities on test scores in K-12 schools in Washington D.C. before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. We want to find out whether students' academic performances been affected by the varying levels of financial support that each school can apply.    
We hypothesize that a school's level of spending plays a factor in how much test scores varied; meaning that the more resources the school was able to provide, the less the math and reading scores dropped from 2019 to 2021.
